|  boxcutter - Extract information from your iTunes Library.                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Apple made a total mess of their "XML" format in their iTunes database. This
script utilizes the Mac::iTunes::Library module to extract this information
into formats more useful to applications other that iTunes.

The original goal of the script was to extract my iTunes playlists into m3u
format so I could use the same playlists on my iPhone/iPod and in mpd.

   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
+--------------------+

Thanks to Drew Stephens for the Mac::iTunes::Library module. I nearly screamed
after seeing Apple's "XML" and before seeing Drew's module.
